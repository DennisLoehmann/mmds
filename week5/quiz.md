# Quiz 5B

## Question 1

+ Measure the point distances by 

		c = sqrt(a^2+b^2)

+ re-calculate the centroids of (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) by
 
		(|x1+x2|/2, |y1+y2|/2)
		

## Question 2

## Question 3

The Bidders will be chosen interchagingly, because the row is like this:

	A	B
	------
	2	2 	-> A or B -> A
	1	2 	-> B
	1	1 	-> A or B -> B
	1  	0 	-> A

Random selection happens only in step 1 and 3. So in the first and third position, there should be an x that can satisfy both.
	

## Question 4

Optimal Solution: 
	AB, CD, EF, GH, length 4

	Dumb = AB BC CD DE EF FG GH, length 7

	7/4 = 1.75
